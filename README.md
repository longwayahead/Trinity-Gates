# Trinity-Gates
A simple application to show students, staff, residents, and the general public which of Trinity College Dublin's gates should be open at present. Gate opening hours are based on the following information:

* Published gate opening hours as supplied by the college (https://www.tcd.ie/Maps/access-times.php)
* Variable holiday opening hours as defined by public holidays in Ireland
* Custom opening hours for special occasions, such as at Christmas, Easter, Trinity Ball, and other events where access to the campus is to be restricted or extended.

This application was written by a student of the university in order to consolidate information on access to the campus, and to make it easier for students and staff to find such information.
